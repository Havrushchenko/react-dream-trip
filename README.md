  ## Description:
  Who hasn't suffered when looking for the cheapest and most affordable flight tickets? Perhaps you remember your favorite airline travel website taking too much when loading your request just to tell you No!, your tickets are higher than we informed or there are no available seats at all!

  We are Dream Trip, a new airline travel platform that searches for the most popular flights all over the world from many airlines at the most affordable prices depending on your travel preference: would you travel by your own or in groups?, prefer a direct flight?, travel with extra luggage? etc.

  When you register and become a new member in our community, we provide you with the latest flight updates and be able to contact us to directly respond you to any query you have.

  ## Usage:
  To start using our app run npm run seed at server folder to seed our flight database.
